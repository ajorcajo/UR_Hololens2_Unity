In this collaborative scholarship, an application has been developed to innovate the teaching of robotics through virtual reality, specifically using the Microsoft HoloLens 2 device. This application, created with the Unity development tool along with the Microsoft Mixed Reality Toolkit, will teach students the different types of movements (MoveJ, MoveL, MoveP) available for a Universal Robots UR3e robot.

Moreover, with mixed reality, users will be able to see the exact path traced by the robot, creating an immersive environment and unique experiences for the user, thus greatly enhancing information retention and learning. This statement has been demonstrated through my following final degree project:

In addition to innovation in teaching, there is also the capability to control the robot in mixed reality, an innovative project that can serve as a foundation for future projects. This also enhances the learning of both students and users worldwide in the field of communication via sockets, between a UR robot and Mixed Reality or Unity.

This Unity project involves using the HoloLens 2 to control a UR robot. I would like to express my gratitude to [Roman Parak’s project](https://github.com/rparak/Unity3D_Robotics_UR/), which provided invaluable assistance and inspiration, making this endeavor much more achievable.hich has been instrumental in my learning about socket connections.

There are different useful panels that can help students to understand concepts of UR movement such as movel, moveJ... In this app, you can use it in different ways: you can program the robot by using points through mixed reality or program the robot with the teach pendant, run it, and then view the path it has taken using the "trail renderer" in Unity. This can be done as long as the "Robot Programming" panel is executed.
